	provide target definitions based on genesez mirror repository
	provide ant target taking such a target definition and creating a runnable sdk (bundle pool)
	provide ant target creating a target definition based on the created bundle pool from the target definition based on genesez mirror repository
	
	Note: does not work that way
	- it works to make the whole genesez mirror repo runnable, 
	but i was unable to figure a good way out to only include specific features versions with its dependencies
	- it does not work to specify iu's when making the genesez mirror repo runnable
	- a good way for local target definitions is to include all content of a directory which just includes a specific dependencies

category.description.org.genesez=GeneSEZ (Generative Software Engineering Zwickau) is a MDSD framework for generation of different artifacts required for software engineering. It was founded by the GeneSEZ research group which is also responsible for maintaining and developing the framework. GeneSEZ sets special value on independence from any particular tools, high project specific adaptability and best possible support of the software engineer without limiting his possibilities.\n\n \
GeneSEZ pursues the concept of forward engineering, i.e. a unidirectional information flow from the abstract data representation, e.g. UML models, to the generated artifacts, e.g. source code. It is based on Eclipse technologies (Eclipse Modeling Project) and uses own meta-models allowing e.g. the change of the data source (e.g. UML, DSL) without making modifications to existing model transformations.

	<!-- 
		just a bunch of workflow components to
		- instantiate an uml2 model
		- transform the model from uml2 meta model to genesez meta model
		  (without profile support)
		
		following parameters are required:
		==================================
		
		$inputModelFile		name of the uml2 file
		$genesezModel		name of the slot which holds the genesez model
		$excludePackages	comma or comma blank [, ] separated list of package names to exclude from transformation
		$mapClassesInModelToExternal	boolean indicating if all classes contained in the model are
										transformed to external classes instead of classifiers
		$externalPackages	comma or comma blank [, ] separated list of package names which are used as container
							for external classes (therefor are not transformed to genesez packages)
		$externalStereotypes	comma or comma blank [, ] separated list of names of stereotypes which are applied 
								to packages	or classes, indicating that the package is a container for external classes
								or the classes are external classes
